# Changelog

All notable changes to **Grok Remote Hub** are documented here.  
Format inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versions follow the hub `__version__` when bumped; otherwise entries are grouped by **release themes** with commit SHAs for GitHub.

This file is the **public narrative**. Session chat context is not required to understand history.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Mobile pretty Hub UI** — self-hosted Inter + system-ui (no Google Fonts / no serif fallback), card home, Working resume cards, sticky primary Send, bottom-sheet modals with a grab handle, idle image/video chrome hidden. Critical inline CSS so Tailscale/Brave never flashes raw desktop HTML. Touch ≥44px kept. Desktop (≥900px) stays compact. Static cache-bust `?v=20260905q`.
- **Mobile-first Hub UI** — phone/tablet portrait uses ≥44px touch targets, full-width primary actions (New / Send / Stop / Approve / Submit / Start), stacked composer above the keyboard, and sheet-style plan / agent-question / new-session / site-preview modals. Desktop (≥900px) stays compact. Working (running/recent) sessions are listed on the empty home for one-tap resume. Static cache-bust `?v=20260905n`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-19

ACP reliability, honest compact, and hub control plane. Remote hub is now a full control plane: chat-ready ACP health, CLI-aligned turn ownership, honest context compact, and session UX that survives refresh, restart, and heavy history.

### Changed
- **New session folder picker** — Projects | Browse segmented tabs; browse mode uses breadcrumbs, folder rows with open chevron, sticky **Use this folder** CTA, loading/empty states; Projects list prioritizes search, shows Recent (localStorage `grh.recentProjects.v1`), and clearer empty copy; entry choice remembers list vs browse for Back.
- **Skip redundant session/load when already warm** — hub tracks session ids successfully `session/new` or `session/load`'d in this process; repeat loads skip the agent RPC (cleared on ACP disconnect). Does not remove model prefill cost of large history on first real prompt.

### Added
- **Cold-session latency hints** — slim banner/composer hint “Loading session into agent…” while attach is in flight; one-time soft note on large context sessions that first reply may take longer (same as CLI), suggesting `/compact` or New. Send is never blocked.
- **ANSI SGR colors in terminal/tool detail** — live `terminal_out` and final tool detail render CSI SGR as colored spans (safe DOM); one-liners / activity strip use plain `strip_ansi`.
- **Session restore on refresh** — last selected chat id stored in `localStorage` (`grh.selectedSession.v1`); bootstrap re-opens that session when it still appears in `/api/sessions` (desktop + mobile).
- **Goal banner with persistent elapsed** — slim `#goal-banner` above the transcript for CLI `/goal` mode (`active` / `paused`); wall-clock elapsed survives turns and refresh via `grh.sessionGoals.v1` + live `update_goal` / slash lifecycle.
- **ACP structured trace** — ring buffer + daily `logs/acp-trace-YYYYMMDD.jsonl`; `GET /api/admin/acp-trace?n=100`; last 5 on `/health` as `acpTraceRecent` (connect/send/recv/probe/heal/compact/quality, no secrets or full prompts).
- **ACP WebSocket ping probe** — after 45s idle silence (no pending RPC), hub pings the agent WS; probe fail forces unhealthy so heal reconnects (no auto-KillAgent).
- **Files media Share/Save** — video preview (mp4/mov/webm/m4v), Web Share API from Files, higher raw serve limit (150 MB), optional `?download=1` Content-Disposition (file-first; ADR 006/010).
- **Binary upload + attach** — `POST /api/fs/upload` into session `uploads/`; composer paperclip and Files Upload; path prefill; image 40 MB / video 150 MB caps + MIME allowlist.
- **Hub plan viewer** — `GET /api/sessions/{id}/plan` reads `plan.md` + `plan_mode.json`; View plan modal.
- **Hub plan-mode handshake** — `POST /api/sessions/{id}/plan/action` writes `plan_mode.json` (approve / request_changes / quit) so Approve clears `awaiting_plan_approval` without stock TUI `a`-key / `exit_plan_mode` (ADR 012); Approve also auto-sends continue inject text. Inline plan strip + View plan only when plan is awaiting/Active (not leftover `plan.md`).
- **ACP quality** — `acpQuality` (`ok`/`stale`/`zombie`/`down`); chat-ready requires quality ok; zombie send-fail disconnect (ADR 013).
- **Restart agent from pill** — when hung/down, click status pill → confirm → `POST /api/admin/restart-agent` (KillAgent-style serve recycle; hub stays up) (ADR 014).
- **Turn telemetry / capacity** — `liveTurns` age/silence/ttfb; capacity banner while work runs.
- **Open-tool wait cues** — strip prefers running over quiet while tools open; local `waiting · Ns` heartbeat.
- **Live terminal_out** — hub terminal/* pump streams deltas to UI tool rows.
- **Tool-row site Preview** — when a tool summary/path ends in `.html`/`.htm`, a compact **Preview** control opens the existing in-hub site preview (file-first; ADR 010).
- **Sticky active user prompt** — scroll-linked You: pin; one-line collapsed by default; click expands; higher contrast sticky bar.

### Removed
- **Heavy-session soft context banner** — dropped `#context-budget-banner` / `contextBudget` status field (journal-size false positives after compact). Context UX matches the CLI usage bar only.

### Fixed
- **Hub `/compact` = ACP `_x.ai/compact_conversation`** — same agent serve path as CLI remote (not session/prompt); no-shrink while session still full is `failed` with signals-grounded “did not free context” message (not cheerful success).
- **Compact feedback grounded in session signals** — /compact and auto-compact toast/system text use signals.json used/window (never "already minimal" while the CTX bar is still full); hub resolves reduced vs still-full vs low and sends an authoritative `message`.
- **No-output heal vs load-replay suppress** — heal no longer force-releases load suppress in `finally` (that cancelled the quiet period); `wait_load_suppress_settled` lets history flush finish; loading always suppresses residual fanout even if an active turn is registered; `session_prompt` settles then releases before `_register_active_turn`.
- **Compact toast vs CTX bar honesty** — compact feedback reports compact-op X→Y only; CTX bar always comes from session signals (no applyUsagePatch from compact after, no flicker when signals stay high).
- **No-output recovery forces session reload** — do not skip `session/load` when already warm/loaded (dead worker produced zero updates); forget warm, real load, reconnect+load on fail. UI restores pending user prompt after history reload/refresh and keeps Resend pending on no-output failures.
- **session/load quiet-period suppress** — hold historical fanout until 1.5s silence (max 20s), rearm on each suppressed frame; fixed 0.3s release no longer lets multi-second history floods thrash the UI.
- **Honest compact feedback** — claim "Context compacted" only when after < before; no-op / missing tokens say no change; hub marks `reduced`/`feedback`; UI rate-limits compact system lines (~4s) and does not patch usage upward from no-op compact.
- **Sticky scroll rate limit** — cap non-forced `scrollIfSticky` to ~10/s (90ms min) so residual update bursts cannot thrash the transcript.
- **Hard reload once after hub process restart** — when `bootId` changes with the page still open, clear live state then `location.reload()` once per bootId (`sessionStorage` `grh.bootReload.*`) so clients never mix cached JS with new Python.
- **Stream merge overlap / double-print** — `mergeStreamText` absorbs redundant suffix and longest prefix/suffix overlap (mixed cumulative+delta); 50ms identical-chunk dedupe on append; pure matrix in `hub.ui_format.merge_stream_text`.
- **Wake mid-tool not cleared on silence alone** — `should_clear_turn_on_wake` / JS mirror keep healthy open tools/plan when `acpQuality` is ok; stale/zombie/down still clear (ADR-015).
- **Session restore-by-id** — bootstrap opens saved session via history when id is missing from top-N list; pin stores cwd+title; 404 clears pin.
- **Visibility/reconnect thrash** — debounced wake (visibility + pageshow + online); reconnect only if WS not OPEN; force history skips apply when fingerprint unchanged; fingerprint includes message count + last full length; scroll freeze without forcing stickToBottom.
- **Turn end always cancel-before-clear** — `AcpClient.end_turn` awaits agent cancel (bounded, prefers last-known method) then `force_clear_turn`; stall watchdog, reset-turn, no-output recovery, and stuck-before-prompt paths use it (no fire-and-forget cancel after unlock).
- **Disable auto-restart-agent after no-output prefill timeouts** — failed no-output retry no longer calls `_restart_agent_process` solely because process is up; fat-session slow first token must not KillAgent other projects (operator restart still available).
- **Redundant session/load on already-warm sessions** — attach/ensure no longer re-hits the agent for a session this process already loaded (avoids extra cold-path delay after the first load).
- **Reconnect/visibility force-refresh history** — after wake, reconnect, or turn idle, force-refresh selected history so the last assistant message appears even if the client still thought a turn was running.
- **Hub prompt-path timing + agent TTFB** — live process-reuse has no warmup waits; logs split hub ensure/send vs agent first update; TTFB excludes `user_message_chunk` / `available_commands_update`.
- **First-byte no-output stays 60s (CLI-like)** — do not scale zero-activity wait by `updates.jsonl` size (was 180/300s on heavy sessions); auto-retry budget 90s; soft surface after failed retry (no auto KillAgent).
- **Wake/reconnect turn re-sync (CLI-aligned, ADR 015)** — after visibility visible, `online`, or WS reconnect, re-fetch `/health` and clear dead turns (cancel + reset when `acpQuality` is stale/zombie/down or silence ≥120s); server is sole authority for idle; healthy turns re-seed timers.
- **Browse projects root missing / wrong default** — default `projects_root` prefers first existing among `~/Projects`, `D:/Projects`, `~/Documents/Projects`; missing root is created when possible; Browse error path shows status (not a blank panel) with config.toml hint on 404.
- **Multi-table messages** — every GFM table in a message body renders as HTML, not only the first.
- **Short GFM table separators** — agent-written tables with 1–2 dashes per separator cell (e.g. `|--|---|`) now render as tables instead of plain text.
- **Orphan agent turn after hub force-clear** — stall watchdog, admin reset-turn, and no-output recovery now call `session/cancel` (via `notify_agent_cancel`) so the agent releases the old prompt; UI unlock no longer leaves the next message blocked forever.
- **Heavy-session no-output false kill** — never suppress ACP activity mid-turn; release load-suppress before re-prompt. (First-byte wait no longer scales by journal size; no-output heal now forces reload — see above.)
- **Turn elapsed/silence timers seed from server age** — strip `running · Ns` and tool `waiting · Ns` survive hard-refresh/reconnect (no more client-only `Date.now()` reset to 0s).
- **session/load historical replay no longer streamed live** — drops agent history flood during load (stops UI tool strobe); history still via REST/WS.
- **Stale ACP heal no longer kills mid-prompt** — heal skips `stale` while a turn is active (stall watchdog owns silent prompts); `ACP_STALE_SECONDS` raised to 90s so quality does not flip before the 60s no-output policy.
- **Compact token sanity** — reject absurd/non-finite compact token counts (>5M or negative) hub-side and in UI so bogus “375k context” / scroll thrash does not paint.
- **`/compact` context bar + feedback** — hub intercepts `/compact` via `_x.ai/compact_conversation`, broadcasts `compact`/`usage` from `_x.ai/session_notification` `auto_compact_*`, and the UI updates the context bar with before→after (or no-op) feedback instead of waiting on the 6s poll alone.
- **Live stream text doubling** — `mergeStreamText` matches history cumulative-vs-delta merge so mid-turn assistant/thought text no longer looks duplicated.
- Tools stay **collapsed** by default; empty expand no longer shows “No detail.”
- Thinking summary no longer doubles the word “Thinking.”
- Composer placeholder adapts to width (short vs slash-hint) with CSS ellipsis.
- Status pill distinguishes agent process up vs ACP disconnected; auto-reconnect ACP when process is up (capped retries).
- Mobile transcript GFM tables re-parse from raw stream text and scroll horizontally.
- Mobile: hide session-banner; sticky You flush to top of chat scroll.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-07-12

Stream feel, session source labels, and restart UX polish on top of the 0.3.x hub.

### Added
- **CLI / Hub source pills** — session rail labels hub-owned vs stock CLI/TUI sessions (`isCli` on the session API; distinct pill colors).
- **Optimistic user bubble** — composer submit paints your message immediately; server echo is deduped.
- **One-tap Resend after hub process restart** — last prompt kept in sessionStorage; Resend on the error strip when a live turn was interrupted (client-first; no server store of prompt text).
- **Stream parity** — clearer Thinking panels, richer tool detail, tools open while running/pending; subagent spawn/finish as system lines in history and live stream.

### Fixed
- **No-output auto-retry** — on first silent turn, hub reloads the same session (reconnect ACP if needed) and resends once; only then surfaces a soft failure. No `session/new`, no map rewrite.
- Nested ACP content shapes for thought/tool text extraction (history + live UI).

### Docs
- README gallery screenshots refreshed from a live hub (sanitized demo titles/paths).

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- **In-hub site preview** (Files tree): double-click or **Preview** on `.html` / `.htm` opens a same-origin modal; **Close** stops the preview instance (`hub/site_preview.py`, `/api/preview/*`, `/preview-site/*`).
- **Public CHANGELOG** — release-oriented history mapped to commits and ADRs.

### Fixed
- Device presets (mobile / tablet / desktop) set a **real iframe viewport** so CSS media queries reflow; no longer only max-width crop. Same fix in CLI Preview Hub chrome.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-12

Hub version bump to **0.3.0**. Concurrent multi-project turns, restart continuity, Preview Hub CLI, public-ready packaging polish.

### Added
- **Multi-turn across projects** — default up to 3 concurrent live turns on different project folders; same-cwd prompts still queue (`max_concurrent_turns`, multi-turn policy).
- **Session continuity after hub restart** — view-first ensure; KeepAgent default on `restart-hub.ps1`; no-output recovery **keeps the same session** (no surprise `session/new` fork). ADR 009.
- **Browser Preview Hub (CLI)** — Node stdlib companion under `tools/preview-hub/` for static/SPA preview when the editor has no Simple Browser (`npm run preview`).
- **Ask-user ACP shapes** aligned with agent `outcome` discriminant; stop/cancel force-clears hub turn state.

## Architecture decision records

Product “why” lives in `docs/adr/` (not only in chat):

| ADR | Topic |
|-----|--------|
| 001 | Session lifecycle / sole-writer |
| 002 | Full ACP client surface |
| 003 | Dual-hub topology (not TUI multi-client) |
| 004 | Detached hub start (WMI) |
| 005–006 | Prompt queue; session cwd file browser |
| 007–008 | Subagent kind; title/rename |
| 009 | KeepAgent + continuity (view-first; no no-output fork) |
| 010 | File-first site preview (not cloud artifacts) |
| 011–014 | Agent vs ACP health; plan handshake; quality; in-hub restart |
| 015–016 | CLI-aligned turn ownership; load quiet-period suppress |

## Reading this on GitHub

1. **Releases** — tag `vX.Y.Z` when shipping; paste the matching section above into the release notes (latest: [v0.4.0](https://github.com/ChrisP-Builds/grok-remote-hub/releases/tag/v0.4.0)).
2. **Commits tab** — still the source of truth for diffs; this changelog is the human index.
3. **Do not rewrite published history** on `master` without a coordinated force-push plan; prefer forward commits + changelog.

### Not in git (by design)

Runtime and lab artifacts stay local: `config.toml`, `data/`, `logs/`, probe dumps, personal screenshots, `.playwright-mcp/`.
