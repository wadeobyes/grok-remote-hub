# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — short markdown
files capturing significant technical decisions and the reasoning behind them.

## Format

See [0000-template.md](0000-template.md) for the template when adding new ADRs.

## Why

ADRs preserve the *why* behind technical choices so future engineers don't
silently revert decisions whose original constraints they don't remember.
One file per decision. Body is immutable once Accepted; supersession is via
a new ADR.

## Conventions

- Filename: `<NNNN>-<short-kebab-title>.md` with zero-padded sequence number.
- Title: H1 in present tense. "Use X" not "Considered using X."
- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNNN.
- Body never changes once Accepted. Edit only the Status line (or append Notes).
